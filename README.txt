### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features
Features: see recipe list in engaging grid form, fuzzy search for recipe by name and cuisine, intelligent handling of link failures

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I wanted to make sure the project looked good, used proper dependency injection and data management.  I wanted to make the app robust and the code production ready/

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
A day and a half.  More than you allotted, but again, I wanted this to be a learning experience for me, and a darn good app.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Yes, I first tried coding this without AI - not raw dogging, but depending on the old StackOverflow and other sources.  I realized, people aren't very
good at writing.  So I did switch to generating a lot of this project with AI.  I understand this is probably disqualifying in your eyes for the job,
but from my perspective, if I want to have a job in two years getting very good at working with AI is not just essential, it's the only important thing.
By focusing on architecture, UX, taste and what truly makes an app delightful to use, I think better apps get made.  So apologies for the iconoclastic
approach, but I truly believe I'm on the right track with this.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I wish there was a better way to handle bad urls.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
Just that it was a lot of fun making this!
